            We have probably read about some of the most popular types of crypto
            currencies such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum. Crypto
            currencies are increasingly popular alternatives for online
            payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            A crypto currency is a digital currency, which is an alternative
            form of payment created using encryption algorithms.The use of
            encryption technologies means that crypto currencies function both
            as a currency and as a virtual accounting system.
          </p>
          <p>
            So by keeping all this in mind i have developed a product that will
            keep track of all the crypto currencies. I have more than 90+
            crypto-currencies data populated on our page which will provide
            exact data of every second of last 365 days on a single chart each
            for every currency. Any person who wants to invest in crypto
            currencies, can see all the past data required to him for the
            investment and to learn about crypto currencies. In future i would
            like to add some new features which will help the users to directly
            invest from our application.
